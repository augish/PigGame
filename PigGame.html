      <h1>Game Rules</h1>
      <p>
        The game has 2 players, playing in rounds. In each turn, a player rolls
        a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his total
        score. If a player rolls a 1, all his total points get lost. After that,
        it's the next player's turn. The player can choose to 'Hold', which
        means that his round score gets added to his total score. After that,
        it's the next player's turn. The first player to reach 100 points on
        total score wins the game.
